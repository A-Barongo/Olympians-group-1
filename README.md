# üè• Olympian Hospital Database

**Olympian Hospital Database** is a command-line application built using **Python** and **SQLAlchemy ORM**, designed to manage hospital operations such as patient records, doctor rosters, and appointment scheduling. This project provides a simple but powerful way to interact with hospital data via a menu-driven CLI interface.
